MVP: Integrating openAI API to provide course recommendations based on the userâ€™s preferences, in addition to developing both the front-end and back-end


Problem Definition:
To design and build an intelligent course recommendation system that personalizes learning experiences by analyzing user preferences. This system will consist of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) backend that processes user data to suggest relevant courses and a user-friendly front end that facilitates user interaction and data input.

AI Model Development: Create a machine learning model capable of understanding and predicting user preferences based on their inputs and interactions. The model will be trained with a diverse dataset to ensure accurate recommendations.

User Preference Intake: Implement a mechanism to capture user preferences, which could include preferred topics, learning styles, past educational history, and other relevant parameters that the AI could use to tailor course suggestions.

Course Database: Compile a comprehensive and categorized list of courses that the AI can choose from when making recommendations. The database should be structured and standardized for ease of integration with the AI model.

Front End Development: Develop a front-end interface that is intuitive and engaging, allowing users to easily input their preferences, receive course recommendations, and access course materials.

Back End Development: Build a robust back end that supports the AI model's functionality, handles data storage and retrieval, and maintains user profiles and their interactions.

Integration and Testing: Ensure that the front end and back end are seamlessly integrated to provide a smooth user experience. Rigorous testing will be performed to validate the AI's recommendation accuracy and the system's overall performance.

BONUS User Feedback Loop: Establish a system for collecting user feedback on course recommendations to continuously improve the AI model.
